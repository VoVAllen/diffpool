Differentiable Pooling PyTorch Implementation
=============================================

This is not official implementaion.

Currently reach 65~70% validation accuracy without link prediction loss on Enzymes Dataset

Graph is batched for accelerating calculations


[paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/1806.08804)


To run the code:
```
python batched_train.py
```
